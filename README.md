# amazon_recommendation_system


The Recommendation System of Amazon follows the principle of generating product based recommendations which means measuring the similarities between two products and then recommend the most similar products to each user.
A good quality product will always have a good collection of reviews so we can use both the similarity score and product reviews to generate recommendations.
